[STM32CubeMX](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-configurators-and-code-generators/stm32cubemx.html) project for my STM32F103C8T6 SPI NOR flash programmer.

Includes:

* Pinout
* Clock config

This was **not** used to generate the skeleton project, only to sketch out the pinout.
